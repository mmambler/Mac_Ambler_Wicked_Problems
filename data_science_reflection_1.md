Wicked Problems - Data Science Reflection #1

Mac Ambler

For this first reflection, I would like to highlight some major advances in the world of measuring, collecting, and analyzing biometric and movement data. These new breakthroughs have come in the form of Cipher Skin, a startup out of Denver that is engineering a new type of wearable technology that would allow scientists to measure the movement and function of the human body with a degree of accuracy never before seen. This technology works through the use of sensor laden mesh compression “Biosleeves,” worn on the shoulder, elbow, hip, or knee. The fabric is organized into a geometric pattern and is in constant communication with itself, so that, as the fabric folds and shifts with the contours of the human body, the sensors can tell as they get closer to or further from each other, and this data is then computed and returned to the user in real time. In addition to this, the mesh has the capability of incorporating any surface based sensors of human biometrics, such as EKG or Oxygen Saturation, so that not only is it possible to monitor in what manner the body is moving but also the vitals and biometrics that are influencing the wearers ability to perform these movements.

This technology has a vast variety of possible uses and allows for many creative solutions to common problems in a number of fields. Imagine a physical therapist being able to analyze the movements of injured patients’ joints instantaneously in order to correct movements, make the healing process more efficient, and provide faster relief to their patients. This could also have a huge impact for professional athletes who, in order to perform on the biggest stage, could analyze and perfect their bodily movements so that they are as efficient as possible while simultaneously monitoring important biometrics for athletic performance such as O2 saturation. This could even possibly be used in the military sphere through a variety of means such as monitoring a soldier’s health and vitals in the heat of conflict or assisting in the training of physical maneuvers. The sky's the limit when it come to the possible uses for the Cipher Skin, and, with the company’s aims to roll out a compression undershirt as well as a pair of leggings, it could be possible to gather data from the body as a whole and not just from specific joints, increasing the possibilities for what this technology could accomplish. One thing is for sure, though: the Cipher Skin has the possibility to revolutionize the world of biometric and movement analysis and is an example of the way that advancements in data science could  have an affect on many aspects of our daily life.
