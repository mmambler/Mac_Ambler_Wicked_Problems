# Data Science Reflection - 2

## Mac Ambler

For this week’s reflection, I would like to talk about an innovation in the collection and communication of baseball data that has taken the industry by storm in the past couple of years. Created by engineer Batuhan Okur, the Rapsodo, a baseball radar device, is changing the way that baseball players train and develop, from Major League teams to even small Summer ball clubs. This device comes in two forms: Rapsodo Pitching and Rapsodo Hitting. I will specifically be talking about the former as it was the first version created, and there is enough to talk about with each of these innovations to warrant their own reflection. 

The Rapsodo Pitching monitor is triangular in shape and designed to be positioned on a 6-foot tripod 6 feet behind home plate. As a pitcher winds up and throws a baseball, the machine’s radar recognizes that the ball is moving and begins taking a rapid succession of photos. The Rapsodo is then able to analyze each of these pictures and calculate a number of variables including the speed at which the ball is traveling, its spin rate, and much more. This is then instantaneously sent to either the Rapsodo app or cloud, where the player can gain real-time insight about their pitch. Rapsodo is not the first company to produce technology capable of this analysis, seeing as it was preceded by systems such as PITCHf/x and TrackMan, but it is the first to have the ability to provide immediate feedback directly to the player. Additionally, Rapsodo has a leg up on its competition because it is small, extremely portable, and only costs a tenth of that of the other systems. 

This technology is extremely useful for baseball players and coaches for a variety of reasons. Firstly, Rapsodo could serve as an excellent teaching tool for coaches of young athletes, providing close analysis of players’ pitches so issues and bad habits can be corrected before they can turn into muscle memory. Additionally, both professional and amature players can use this to modify their pitching form and see how it affects the data, looking to produce more desirable outcomes such as increased spin rate, velocity, or break. This could even possibly be used to classify a pitcher’s skill set and compare them to other players with those same skills that have found success. The athlete can then have a model of success to strive for and can improve in certain key areas to become the best player they can be. 

Ultimately, this is yet another analytical advancement in a field that has been on the forefront of the data revolution in recent years. If teams can continue to create and innovate new technologies to better collect, interpret, and communicate data, it is likely that the way games are won and lost will forever be changed, and Rapsodo is a prime example of this.
