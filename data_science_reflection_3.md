Data Science Reflection #3

Mac Ambler

For this week’s reflection, I would like to talk about an up-and-coming technology in the world of basketball analytics that has the potential to change the way the game is played and has begun to find traction among some major teams and franchises. This technology is ShotTracker, a new method of collecting, analyzing, and communicating basketball data invented by Bruce Ianni and Davyeon Ross in 2013. The two were searching for a way of aiding young players, such as Ianni’s son, in their shooting development by creating a method of easily tracking and recording player shooting and efficiency. The resulting ShotTracker then garnered a great deal of attention from coaches and other interested parties prompting Ianni and Ross to revamp their technology in 2015 to better fit their market.

ShotTracker works through a system of motion sensors and cameras to record the locations and statistics of not only the basketball, but players as well, as they traverse back and forth along the court. There are three main components to this technology: a small sensor worn on the uniform of each of the players, a sensor located inside of the ball, and multiple cameras designed to be positioned throughout any arena or practice facility. These three work together to analyze events on the court, compute over 70 statistics, and communicate these to the user in real-time. Additionally, the system keeps track of each player's tendencies, strengths, and weaknesses and uses an artificial intelligence system to suggest lineup configurations and strategies for nearly any scenario.

These capabilities could prove invaluable to coaches as they gain an even better understanding of the qualities that each of their players possesses that may not be apparent to the naked eye. In a game that stresses the importance of efficiency, knowing what specific areas of a team’s play to target and work on could make the difference between a team on the edge of contention and a champion. This technology is not purely for coaches and athletes either. It has even been designed to easily integrate into live broadcasts of games and comes with an app that communicates real-time data so that fans at home or in the stadium can follow along as well.

ShotTracker has already been picked up and utilized by a number of Division I College Basketball programs, including TCU, Benedictine, and Air Force, and there are surely more to follow. Basketball is one of a number of sports that has lagged behind in terms of analytical innovation, but the game is slowly catching up with those ahead of the curve such as baseball. I would not be surprised if technologies such as ShotTracker become more and more prevalent in the coming years, and even make their way into the professional game, as players and coaches continue to find new ways to improve performance and win games.
