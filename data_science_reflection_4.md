Data Science Reflection #4
Mac Ambler

For this week’s reflection, I learned about a recently-released software that has the capability to change the way businesses and individuals access, organize, manipulate, and plot data. Created by University of Wisconsin-Madison computer science professor Jignesh Patel, DataChat brilliantly combines artificial intelligence and data science to give individuals and companies the ability to receive meaningful insights from data without requiring expertise in computer science. The secret behind this innovative software is its ability to use what Patel and his team refer to as “conversational intelligence.” This means that the user enters a request in plain english into the console, and DataChat’s system is able to interpret exactly what is being asked of the program and returns said result.

To get an idea of what this program is capable of, a user could ask for anything from a dataframe, filtered so that only certain relevant information is shown, to a scatterplot with a linear regression line, or even a geometric plot of locations that fit a specific criteria. There could be an almost infinite number of uses for a program such as this. Some possibilities might be a small business owner using DataChat to grow and advanced her business by making processes more efficient and putting out products that the consumer is more likely to buy, a youth sports coach easily retrieving and managing the stats of his players to help develop their performance more efficiently, or a middle school teacher utilizing data from assessments and other class activities to create a better learning environment for the students in her class. The one common thread in all of these cases is that everyday people can gather this information without needing much knowledge of programming or data science whatsoever. This makes actionable insights more available to people in all facets of daily life than ever before.

DataChat is what is known as an “SaaS” or “Software as a Service.” The product is the software itself, and companies and individuals pay a subscription cost in order to use it. The value of such a service has not gone unnoticed in that Patel’s creation to this point has already received over $4 million in investments from Silicon Valley venture capital firms, like WRVI Capital and Nepenthe Capital. DataChat is already being used by multiple yet-to-be-named companies, and, in a world that is ever increasingly more reliant on data and analytics, I believe many more will begin to utilize this amazing tool in the coming years. This software could have immense value for people all across the country and around the world, and, should technologies such as this continue to grow, one might find that the world is a little bit more efficient, accessible, and all around brighter for all.
