Data Science Reflection #5
Mac Ambler

Since entering the age of the computer in the late-20th century and into the 21st, the human race has been constantly striving to advance ourselves and push technology to its very limits. These advancements opened the door for the new realm of data analysis and data science that afforded us the opportunity to observe the world in which we live in ways never before seen. The advent of data science serves to advance our understanding of complex adaptive, economic, and social systems by providing us with new ways to collect, observe, and analyze data in order to gain actionable insights and strengthened predictions.

Perhaps the area in which this new, technologically-driven way of thinking has most altered our view of the world is in the ability to observe the complex interactions that explain how people, places, and objects adapt and change. Through the use of geographic (or geospatial) data we can gain a better picture of what space humans occupy in conjunction with the natural geography, topography, and environmental conditions that surround them. By contrasting this with data from the past, we can answer more questions than ever before on how people adapt and change with their environment, such as: why population density increases in a particular region over time, why people live closer to certain bodies of water than others, or even why livestock and herders in certain developing nations engage in transhumance. Going a step further, insights about adaptive systems don’t only have to come through comparison to the past, but can allow us to look to and draw conclusions about the future. In this way, one is better able to tackle new challenges that may present themselves, and thus data science not only provides information on adaptation but also aids in the process itself. Understanding how individual beings, objects, and environments evolve is invaluable when it comes to preparing for future adaptations and changes, and this is just one tool that we as humans have gained through the growth of data science.

One could argue that the one sector of our society that is most susceptible to changes, adaptations, and the influence of others is the economy, and by utilizing big data we can gain more knowledge about the complex interactions that affect the distribution of wealth in our world. First and foremost, we as humans are better able to comprehend the current state of our market, and through this we are more prepared to predict what will happen going forward. There is a wealth of economic information available today and there is more and more being produced every second. By employing this knowledge, we can create models to perform any number of tasks, such as finding what factors correlate most to an increase in GDP, predicting the value of stocks, or even finding what factors most often lead to economic downturn and using this knowledge to avoid the next recession. Not only can one learn more about economic systems from the outside, but business owners can use data analytics to better reach their consumers and grow their own ventures. By gaining a better scope of current and past market states, predicting future outcomes, and facilitating more efficient connection between businesses and consumers, data science and analytics allows us to work toward fighting poverty and producing a more stable economic environment for all.

The scope of data science’s influence is not purely constrained to adaptive and economic systems. In fact, one facet of society that has been severely altered by big data’s capabilities has been basic social interactions. Since the internet became readily available to the public, people spend more time out of their day engaging socially and sharing personal information online, rather than in person. Companies like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have turned this development into a business model, and they utilize data science and analytics in numerous ways to try to better understand human social interactions. Social media companies define their success by the length of time they can get a user to interact with their service before losing interest. They are able to incorporate data into this pursuit in a number of ways, such as tailoring advertisements to appeal to certain viewers, using targeted notifications to entice the user to return to their platform, and keeping track of user interactions and activity to create a personalized feed that is more engaging. This ultimately filters the way that individuals in our society experience social interaction, and thus big data has an enormous influence on our modern societal structure.

Ultimately, the human story is one of advancement and innovation, and it seems that every era in history has experienced some form of inventive technology or way of thinking that pushes society to new heights. The advent of big data and data science as a whole fits this mold, and provides a greater capability to understand others and the world in which we live than ever before. The one reason above all others that data science is so important in our modern society, though, is that it offers something that no previous innovation ever has: the capability to not only understand where we have been, but also predict where we are going.
