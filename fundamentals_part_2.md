# Fundamentals - Part 2 Plots

## Absolute Increase in Population

This plot shows the population totals of each U.S. state during the years spanning from 2010 to 2014, as obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau. From this we can see how much the population of each state has increased, and how large the states' populations are compared to that of other states. It has been segmented into 9 smaller plots based on population size to allow for better readability and interpretation.

## Average Growth Rate of Population 

This plot shows the same data as the plot above, however it has been segmented into 9 groups based on average growth rate rather than population size. This means that states found on the same plot will be more similar in their rate of growth, but not, however, in total population size. As before, it has been segmented to provide for better readability and interpretation of the data.
