# Fundamentals - Part 1 Plot

These graphs show the growth or decay in total population of each U.S. state from the year 2000 to 2010 and 2014, as recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau. The plot has been split up into four smaller graphs based on quantiles of population size so as to make them easier to read and interpret.
